### Task 5 

NullByte `%00`
> Using null bytes is an injection technique where URL-encoded representation such as %00 or 0x00 in hex with user-supplied data to terminate strings. You could think of it as trying to trick the web app into disregarding whatever comes after the Null Byte.

> By adding the Null Byte at the end of the payload, we tell the  include function to ignore anything after the null byte which may look like:   
include("languages/../../../../../etc/passwd%00").".php"); which equivalent to â†’ include("languages/../../../../../etc/passwd");
